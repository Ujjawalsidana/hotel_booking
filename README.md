Root test cases which I take care of while making this app 
Guest Count Selection
Test Case 1: Check that the number of guests dropdown works correctly.
Input: Select 1, 2, or 3 from the dropdown.
Expected Output: The dropdown correctly updates to show the appropriate number of guest name fields.

Test Case 2: Ensure that the guest name input fields are displayed dynamically based on guest count.
Form Field Validation

Test Case 3: Verify required fields (phone, email, number of guests, and guest names).
Input: Leave any required field empty and attempt to submit.
Expected Output: The form should display an error or prevent submission if any required field is left empty.

Test Case 4: Check if the email field accepts a valid email address.

Test Case 5: Check if form data is submitted successfully when all fields are valid.

Test Case 6: Check if the form provides proper focus management

Test Case 7: Test form submission with incorrect or missing data.
